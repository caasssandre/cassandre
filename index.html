          Learning at Enspiral Dev Academy is in many ways akin to having work experience as a developer. During the 9 weeks of the bootcamp, I learned pair programming and worked in teams of 3 to 8 developers. I had the opportunity to act as the product owner of a 2 day project as well as the final week long project. We covered the basic agile concepts and implemented standups, retrospectives and kanban boards. We learned how to give and receive feedback. I learned how to be a valuable member of a tech team.

          I have enjoyed my career as an osteopath and learned a lot from it. I decided to make a change in my life to have a greater positive impact and have more opportunity for self development. The following points outline the key skills I refined that will transfer to my new career as a web developer.

        <ul class="right">
          <li>Applied analytic skills and problem solving</li>
          <li>Learned to recognise patterns and trends</li>
          <li>Refined communication and people skills</li>
          <li>Focused on self-reflection and critical analysis</li>

        <p class="paragraph">
          I have a wealth of work experience that has shaped who I am today as a person and as a worker. I have worked in
          hospitality from the age of 16, learning to deal with high stress situations. I have worked in fast paced
          restaurant environments in Italy, Australia, France and England. I had to learn the language, cultural subtleties and
          standard job requirements simultaneously. I have received praise from my employers for my hard work and
          dedication to improving my perfomance.

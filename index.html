        I am a passionate and curious individual and have varied work experience. I have picked up many skills such as customer care, efficient work flow and team work from 10 years in hospitality.

      <p class="paragraph">
        For 6 years, I focused on helping people improve their health and reduce pain. The job requires high self-discipline and exceptional communication skills. As an osteopath, it is important to understand patterns in order to diagnose. It is also crucial to find solutions that suit each individual patient. This honed my problem solving skills and my ability to understand a patient's experience.

      <p class="paragraph">
        I have a wealth of work experience that has shaped who I am today as a person and as a worker. I have worked in hospitality from the age of 16, learning to deal with high stress situations. I have worked in fast paced restaurant environments both in Italy and in Australia having to learn the language, cultural subtleties and standard job requirements simultaneously. I have received praise from my employers for my hard work and dedication to improving my perfomance.
